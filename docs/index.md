## What This Site Covers

This documentation complements the repository `README` files with a browsable guide for skill users and maintainers. It focuses on the repeatable path from `Unknown` to a working setup, then extends that path into a practical development workflow.

## Main Paths

- Start with [Quick Start](/guide/quickstart) when you want the shortest path to a working setup.
- Open [Diagnosis Playbook](/guide/diagnosis) when you need the full decision flow.
- Use [Development Support](/guide/development) when you want reusable scripts, sample sketches, and a repeatable CLI workflow.
- Switch to [Japanese docs](/ja/) if you want the same structure in Japanese.
